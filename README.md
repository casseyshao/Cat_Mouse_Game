# cat_and_mouse_game

This project was completed by Valentina and I.
It is played on the DE1-SoC board.

It can be simulated on CPUator by copying the array definitions in visuals.h to the respective function in the cat_and_mouse_game_code.c file.
The warnings on CPUlator that need to be disabled are:
1. Device-specific warnings
2. Function nesting too deep
3. Interrupt nesting too deep
